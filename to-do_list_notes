chord progression generator
the different instrument parts possible and how to pick them
random rhythm generation in the melody generation that sounds good
bass generator?
random structure generator

after the midi generation part is done:
somehow convert midi to actual audio of each part playing their generated midi

add options to main like deciding what key or deciding how long etc
organization
reading mode probabilities from a file rather than global variables maybe


notes

melody generation aspects
- how many bars
- maybe using short motifs that get edited
- rhythm speed?
